In this\n\n2\n00:00:03,126 --> 00:00:04,790\nvideo, let's take a look at the\n\n3\n00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,686\nsecond sorting algorithm, which\n\n4\n00:00:06,718 --> 00:00:09,806\nis insertion sort. The problem\n\n5\n00:00:09,878 --> 00:00:11,610\nstatement remains the same.\n\n6\n00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,118\nGiven an array of integers sort,\n\n7\n00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:17,966\nthe array sorting can either be\n\n8\n00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:20,558\nascending or descending. For\n\n9\n00:00:20,574 --> 00:00:23,486\nexample, if we have an array of\n\n10\n00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:26,928\nfive integers, passing the array\n\n11\n00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:28,856\ninto insertionsort function\n\n12\n00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:30,936\nshould return the same array in\n\n13\n00:00:30,968 --> 00:00:34,024\nascending order. Let's first\n\n14\n00:00:34,072 --> 00:00:35,504\nunderstand the idea behind\n\n15\n00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:38,776\ninsertion sort. With insertion\n\n16\n00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:41,440\nsort, you virtually split the\n\n17\n00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,576\narray into a sorted and an\n\n18\n00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:46,864\nunsorted part. Since one item by\n\n19\n00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:49,584\ndefinition is always sorted, we\n\n20\n00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,504\nassume that the first element is\n\n21\n00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,754\nsorted and remaining elements\n\n22\n00:00:53,842 --> 00:00:57,106\nare unsorted. You then select\n\n23\n00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:59,442\nan unsorted element and compare\n\n24\n00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:00,842\nwith all the elements in the\n\n25\n00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:03,594\nsorted part. If the elements in\n\n26\n00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:05,858\nthe sorted part is smaller than\n\n27\n00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:08,138\nthe selected element, proceed to\n\n28\n00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:09,810\nthe next element in the unsorted\n\n29\n00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,306\npart. Else shift larger elements\n\n30\n00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:15,130\nin the sorted part towards the\n\n31\n00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,562\nright. You then insert the\n\n32\n00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:20,114\nselected element at the right\n\n33\n00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:22,638\nindex, ensuring the sorted part\n\n34\n00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:25,890\nremains that way. Finally,\n\n35\n00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,886\nrepeat the above steps for all\n\n36\n00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:30,374\nthe unsorted elements in the\n\n37\n00:01:30,422 --> 00:01:33,758\narray. Of course, these points\n\n38\n00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:35,246\nmight be difficult to\n\n39\n00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:36,886\nunderstand, so let me help you\n\n40\n00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:38,610\nvisualize with an example.\n\n41\n00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,502\nConsider the array from our\n\n42\n00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:45,846\nexample. Minus 628,\n\n43\n00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,882\nminus two and four. I've omitted\n\n44\n00:01:48,906 --> 00:01:50,466\nthe comma as it gets a bit too\n\n45\n00:01:50,498 --> 00:01:53,770\ncrowded. Here is how insertion\n\n46\n00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,874\nsort works. You begin by\n\n47\n00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:58,578\nassuming the first element in\n\n48\n00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:00,950\nthe array is already sorted.\n\n49\n00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,330\nRemaining four elements are\n\n50\n00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,874\nunsorted. You start at index\n\n51\n00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:09,074\none, which is the first unsorted\n\n52\n00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:11,258\nelement. Let's store it in a\n\n53\n00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:12,914\nvariable called number to\n\n54\n00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:15,670\ninsert, or NTI for short.\n\n55\n00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,614\nYou compare it with the sorted\n\n56\n00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:20,598\nelements on its left to see if\n\n57\n00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:23,846\nit is out of order. We have one\n\n58\n00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:25,798\nsorted element which is minus\n\n59\n00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,610\nsix. Lets represent that as se\n\n60\n00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,326\nsorted element. For short. We\n\n61\n00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:35,118\ncheck if the sorted element is\n\n62\n00:02:35,174 --> 00:02:36,654\ngreater than the number to\n\n63\n00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:39,862\ninsert. Is minus six greater\n\n64\n00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:43,220\nthan 20. The answer is no.\n\n65\n00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,200\nIn that case, place 20 to the\n\n66\n00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,472\nright of minus six. Of course\n\n67\n00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,040\nthere is no change in our\n\n68\n00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,952\nscenario as 20 is already to the\n\n69\n00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:55,620\nright of minus six.\n\n70\n00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,472\nMinus six and 20 now form the\n\n71\n00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:03,000\nsorted part of the array. Next\n\n72\n00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,800\nwe pick eight, which is from the\n\n73\n00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,700\nunsorted part of the array.\n\n74\n00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,230\nLet's store eight as number to\n\n75\n00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,742\ninsert. We compare it with the\n\n76\n00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:15,750\nsorted elements first. We start\n\n77\n00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,486\nat 20. Is 20 greater than\n\n78\n00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:24,158\neight? Yes, it is. So shift 21\n\n79\n00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:27,150\nposition to the right. We now\n\n80\n00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,358\nhave 20 twice, but that is ok as\n\n81\n00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:31,870\neight is stored in a variable\n\n82\n00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,052\ncalled number to insert a and we\n\n83\n00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:35,960\nhaven't lost track of it.\n\n84\n00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,772\nAfter 20, the next\n\n85\n00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:43,884\nsorted element is minus six. Is\n\n86\n00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,200\nminus six greater than eight?\n\n87\n00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,548\nNo. So place eight which is the\n\n88\n00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:52,268\nnumber to insert one position to\n\n89\n00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:55,484\nthe right of minus six. Our\n\n90\n00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:57,324\nsorted part of the array is now\n\n91\n00:03:57,412 --> 00:03:59,960\nminus six, eight and 20.\n\n92\n00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,058\nThe next unsorted element is\n\n93\n00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:06,018\nminus two. Compare it with\n\n94\n00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:07,890\nsorted part and shift the sorted\n\n95\n00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,386\nelements as necessary. Is 20\n\n96\n00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:14,834\ngreater than minus two? Yes. So\n\n97\n00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:18,402\nshift to the right. Next is\n\n98\n00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,310\neight greater than minus two?\n\n99\n00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,910\nYes. So shift to the right.\n\n100\n00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,266\nNext is minus six greater than\n\n101\n00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:30,368\nminus two? No. So place minus\n\n102\n00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:32,900\ntwo to the right of minus six.\n\n103\n00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,824\nOur sorted part is now minus\n\n104\n00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:38,740\nsix, minus two, eight and 20.\n\n105\n00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,192\nFinally, the unsorted element is\n\n106\n00:04:42,256 --> 00:04:45,352\nfour. Compare again with the\n\n107\n00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:47,080\nsorted part which lies to the\n\n108\n00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,580\nleft. Is 20 greater than four?\n\n109\n00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,820\nYes. So shift 20 to the right.\n\n110\n00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,390\nNext is eight greater than four.\n\n111\n00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,070\nYes. So shift to the right.\n\n112\n00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,530\nNext is minus two greater than\n\n113\n00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,706\nfour? No. So place four to the\n\n114\n00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:11,938\nright of minus two. Our sorted\n\n115\n00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:14,434\narray is now minus six, minus\n\n116\n00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:18,346\ntwo, four, eight and 20. We have\n\n117\n00:05:18,378 --> 00:05:20,210\nreached the end of the array,\n\n118\n00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,248\nwhich means I the entire array\n\n119\n00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:25,848\nis now sorted. This is how the\n\n120\n00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:28,380\ninsertion sort algorithm works.\n\n121\n00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,480\nAlright, if you've understood\n\n122\n00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,424\nthe algorithm, now is the time\n\n123\n00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:35,152\nto pause and implement the\n\n124\n00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:37,408\nsolution. If you would like to\n\n125\n00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:39,624\nsolve together, let's do so in\n\n126\n00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:40,040\nthe next video.\n\n",

I'm so excited. This\n\n5\n00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:09,881\nhas been six months in the\n\n6\n00:00:09,913 --> 00:00:12,129\nworks. So in this one I'm going\n\n7\n00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,169\nto teach you everything from\n\n8\n00:00:13,217 --> 00:00:14,369\nscratch. We're going to start by\n\n9\n00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:16,137\nbuying a domain. We're going to\n\n10\n00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:17,553\ndeploy an e commerce website\n\n11\n00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,729\nhere with next JS14. We're going\n\n12\n00:00:19,737 --> 00:00:21,089\nto be using drizzle\n\n13\n00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:23,529\nauthentication with password and\n\n14\n00:00:23,577 --> 00:00:25,361\nusers. I'll show you how you can\n\n15\n00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:27,019\ndo emails. Let me just show you.\n\n16\n00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:28,527\nLet me just show you. So this is\n\n17\n00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:31,431\nrunning next JS14. We have our e\n\n18\n00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:32,983\ncommerce website here. I'll show\n\n19\n00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,175\nyou how we can statically\n\n20\n00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:36,023\ngenerate these pages as well.\n\n21\n00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,575\nAs you can see, we have reviews\n\n22\n00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:39,135\non these products as well and\n\n23\n00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:40,791\ndifferent types of products. So\n\n24\n00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:42,415\nyou can click and toggle between\n\n25\n00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:43,999\nthem just like that. As you can\n\n26\n00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:45,183\nsee, we have a nice carousel\n\n27\n00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,751\nhere and we can even share this\n\n28\n00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:48,207\nlink. As you can see, the state\n\n29\n00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:50,111\ngets saved there. So if I want\n\n30\n00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:52,215\nto share this pink one I can.\n\n31\n00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:53,889\nAnd if I go to the yellow one.\n\n32\n00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:55,333\nThere we go. As you can see, we\n\n33\n00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:56,997\nhave reviews here as well that\n\n34\n00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:58,093\nwe can leave. I don't think I\n\n35\n00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,677\ncan leave another one now\n\n36\n00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:01,317\nbecause this product already has\n\n37\n00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:03,021\na review. So I'll just leave it\n\n38\n00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:04,461\nthere. Let's try to find a\n\n39\n00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:05,597\nproduct that doesn't have a\n\n40\n00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:08,029\nReview. Give it 5 stars. Add.\n\n41\n00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:09,141\nAs you can see, we have these\n\n42\n00:01:09,173 --> 00:01:10,565\nnice animations with Framer\n\n43\n00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:12,557\nMotion. We're using Chat CN as\n\n44\n00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:13,957\nwell so we can toggle between\n\n45\n00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:16,333\ndark mode and light mode. And as\n\n46\n00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:18,501\nyou can see, the reviews stay on\n\n47\n00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:20,877\non these different product\n\n48\n00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:21,997\nvariants as well because it's\n\n49\n00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:24,133\nthe same product so it should\n\n50\n00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:26,477\nalso have that. Let's go back\n\n51\n00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:27,901\nhere. Let me show you something.\n\n52\n00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:29,701\nWe have this tag system as well\n\n53\n00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:31,189\nthat you can add where you can\n\n54\n00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:33,021\nfilter products either by color,\n\n55\n00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,229\nby whatever you want. Pretty\n\n56\n00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:35,749\nmuch. I added just an example\n\n57\n00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:37,013\nhere with colors, but I'll show\n\n58\n00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,157\nyou how we have this hooked up\n\n59\n00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,069\nas well. And next up we also\n\n60\n00:01:40,117 --> 00:01:42,325\nhave Algolia searched up for\n\n61\n00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:44,453\nSmart Search with AI. So if I do\n\n62\n00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,935\nhighlighter, as you can see,\n\n63\n00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:47,363\nI'll show you how you can\n\n64\n00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:49,011\nimplement this component all\n\n65\n00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:50,483\nfrom scratch. So that's super\n\n66\n00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,659\ncool. Now what else? How are\n\n67\n00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:54,051\nthese products getting made?\n\n68\n00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:55,883\nWell, check this out. When\n\n69\n00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:57,523\nyou're an admin, I'll show you\n\n70\n00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,107\nhow you can build out this whole\n\n71\n00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:02,515\nnice board here for the user.\n\n72\n00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,059\nBut look at this. We're also\n\n73\n00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:05,395\ngoing to learn how to build out\n\n74\n00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:07,363\na full like analytics section\n\n75\n00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,443\nhere where we get to create\n\n76\n00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:10,603\nproducts we can Update. As you\n\n77\n00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,171\ncan see, the user here, I can\n\n78\n00:02:12,203 --> 00:02:14,141\nchange the avatar, change the\n\n79\n00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:15,841\npassword. I can reset the\n\n80\n00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:17,409\npassword if I want to. Let me\n\n81\n00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:18,649\njust go back to analytics as\n\n82\n00:02:18,657 --> 00:02:20,165\nwell. Here we can see the latest\n\n83\n00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:21,913\nproducts that people bought.\n\n84\n00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:24,633\nHow many? 15. It looks like\n\n85\n00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:26,577\nsomeone found the website, so\n\n86\n00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:28,121\nthat's pretty cool. I'll show\n\n87\n00:02:28,153 --> 00:02:29,409\nyou how you can do charts with\n\n88\n00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:30,897\nanalytics. Now, I don't have any\n\n89\n00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:31,993\nother ones here, unfortunately\n\n90\n00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:33,937\nin these days because this is\n\n91\n00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:36,205\nquite new. But look, we made $94\n\n92\n00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:38,009\nthis week, so that's cool. You\n\n93\n00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:39,417\ncan check month as well. So\n\n94\n00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:41,475\nthere we go. This is two weeks\n\n95\n00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:44,491\nago and this week we made 74.\n\n96\n00:02:44,603 --> 00:02:45,947\nSo you can even preview that\n\n97\n00:02:46,011 --> 00:02:47,603\nagain. You'd normally have data\n\n98\n00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:48,515\nhere. I don't have,\n\n99\n00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:49,987\nunfortunately. So I just left it\n\n100\n00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:51,547\nlike that. Now check this out.\n\n101\n00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,003\nWe get to create products as\n\n102\n00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:53,867\nwell. And when you create a\n\n103\n00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:55,403\nproduct here, it actually syncs\n\n104\n00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:57,171\nup with Algolia and it creates\n\n105\n00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:58,739\nthe product with stripes. We can\n\n106\n00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:00,819\ninstantly purchase it. So let me\n\n107\n00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:01,875\njust give you an example here.\n\n108\n00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,395\nWe'll create a fake product.\n\n109\n00:03:03,555 --> 00:03:06,837\nThis is obviously a fake\n\n110\n00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:08,253\nproduct. And as you can see, we\n\n111\n00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:09,845\nhave a nice rich text editor\n\n112\n00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:11,277\nhere. And if you have a look on\n\n113\n00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:12,573\nthe front page here, this is\n\n114\n00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:14,181\nwhere that rich text editor is\n\n115\n00:03:14,213 --> 00:03:15,613\ncoming. All of this information\n\n116\n00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,621\nis coming from this form here.\n\n117\n00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:22,109\nSo this would be my rich text.\n\n118\n00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:23,789\nAs you can see, I can add like\n\n119\n00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,189\nbullet list as well. Whatever\n\n120\n00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:26,317\nyou want. I'll show you how you\n\n121\n00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:28,061\ncan customize this and add\n\n122\n00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:29,493\nwhatever features you want to\n\n123\n00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,821\nit. Just leave it like that for\n\n124\n00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:33,517\nnow. We can also expand this if\n\n125\n00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,549\nwe want to. We can select the\n\n126\n00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:38,117\nprice 24. Now you might be\n\n127\n00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:39,645\nwondering, okay, how did you do\n\n128\n00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,381\nthis thing here? Well, check\n\n129\n00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:43,405\nthis out. We can create variants\n\n130\n00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:44,333\nfor the product because you\n\n131\n00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,653\nmight have like a book or a\n\n132\n00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:46,901\npencil that can have like\n\n133\n00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:47,701\ndifferent colors, different\n\n134\n00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:49,053\nshapes, whatever, so you can\n\n135\n00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,517\ncreate variants for it. So take\n\n136\n00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,757\na look. How cool is this? I can\n\n137\n00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:53,701\ncreate two, three variants maybe\n\n138\n00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,093\nlet's just do two. So there we\n\n139\n00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,741\ngo. I made two products here, a\n\n140\n00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:58,301\nred version and a blue version.\n\n141\n00:03:58,373 --> 00:03:59,925\nLet me also upload some images\n\n142\n00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:02,307\nhere as well. There we go. And\n\n143\n00:04:02,331 --> 00:04:03,931\nagain, I can go here and reorder\n\n144\n00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:05,187\nthese if I want to. So I can\n\n145\n00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,339\ndrag this up like that and boom,\n\n146\n00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:09,043\nthere we go. We can also\n\n147\n00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,627\nvisualize the orders here that\n\n148\n00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,107\nthe users make, or I make in\n\n149\n00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:13,667\nthis case. So basically you'd\n\n150\n00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:17,579\nhave like analytics here and the\n\n151\n00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:18,987\ncreate and products. This would\n\n152\n00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:20,899\nall be hidden if you're not an\n\n153\n00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:22,731\nadmin, but as a user, you're\n\n154\n00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,035\nonly going to have orders and\n\n155\n00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:26,435\nsettings here. So there are a\n\n156\n00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:27,587\ncouple here that are pending and\n\n157\n00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:29,211\nuncompleted. I left these out\n\n158\n00:04:29,283 --> 00:04:30,771\nbecause the web hooks weren't\n\n159\n00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,363\nrunning. But you will, you will\n\n160\n00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:33,731\nhave it like this. Succeeded.\n\n161\n00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:34,923\nSo you can see, as you can see,\n\n162\n00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:37,955\nthe order number, the, the, the\n\n163\n00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:39,971\nprice as well. We can view the\n\n164\n00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:41,267\norder details. As you can see,\n\n165\n00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,387\nthose are the items that I\n\n166\n00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:43,491\nbought. We can download the\n\n167\n00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:44,723\nreceipt as well. So I'll show\n\n168\n00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:45,755\nyou how you can hook it up to\n\n169\n00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:49,291\nStripe like that. And yeah, so\n\n170\n00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:50,691\nnow that we made this, if you\n\n171\n00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:51,947\njust go back to the front page,\n\n172\n00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:53,419\nyou're going to see that product\n\n173\n00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:56,255\nis already here. So here we go.\n\n174\n00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:58,415\nTwo products that we can click\n\n175\n00:04:58,455 --> 00:04:59,927\non. And as you can see, that was\n\n176\n00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,715\nthe first variant that we made.\n\n177\n00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:03,463\nAnd then we can click on this\n\n178\n00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,175\nother one to get the other one\n\n179\n00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:07,735\nas well. And again, this is all,\n\n180\n00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:08,695\nas you can see, that's already\n\n181\n00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,807\nhooked up to Algolia now. So\n\n182\n00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:12,247\nthat's pretty cool. All right,\n\n183\n00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,959\nthose are some like bad examples\n\n184\n00:05:14,007 --> 00:05:15,567\nhere. That was just testing. So\n\n185\n00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:16,719\nlet's just go and clear these\n\n186\n00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:19,583\nout. Set here, hit delete, get\n\n187\n00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,537\nrid of that. Lovely. So there we\n\n188\n00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:24,241\ngo. Let's head back here. It's\n\n189\n00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:26,057\nall cleaned up. So now here is\n\n190\n00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:27,937\nour cart. As you can see, we\n\n191\n00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,361\ndon't have any items in the cart\n\n192\n00:05:29,393 --> 00:05:30,937\nyet. So let's purchase some\n\n193\n00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:32,481\nstuff. Let's add this one.\n\n194\n00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,825\nLet's also maybe add a bag here.\n\n195\n00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:36,233\nI can choose two as well if I\n\n196\n00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:37,985\nwant two of those. Pop this\n\n197\n00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,457\nopen. As you can see, we have\n\n198\n00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:40,681\nthe two items. Check out this\n\n199\n00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:42,225\ncool little animation here. If I\n\n200\n00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:44,577\nincrement this. There we go.\n\n201\n00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:46,525\nHow cool is that? Go down one.\n\n202\n00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:49,067\nNice. That's a checkout. We're\n\n203\n00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:50,283\ngoing to be using Stripe here.\n\n204\n00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:52,215\nThat's all custom built in.\n\n205\n00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:54,975\nLet's add 4242 for everything.\n\n206\n00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,435\nOkay, now I'll turn this off\n\n207\n00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:01,699\nnow. If it errors, I'm still\n\n208\n00:06:01,747 --> 00:06:03,539\ngoing to go through just so we\n\n209\n00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:05,291\ncan go through this quickly.\n\n210\n00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:06,491\nAnd there we go. We can view our\n\n211\n00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:08,107\norder and then your order is\n\n212\n00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:09,707\ngoing to come through here just\n\n213\n00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:10,731\nlike that. Again, that webhook\n\n214\n00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:11,627\nis not running, so it's not\n\n215\n00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:12,771\ngoing to update it in the\n\n216\n00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:14,581\ncorrect manner. But there we go.\n\n217\n00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:16,421\nAnd then here our cart resets.\n\n218\n00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:19,317\nNow you're going to get an email\n\n219\n00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:21,077\nas well with the order number.\n\n220\n00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:22,941\nAnd if you go to analytics now,\n\n221\n00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:24,349\nit should say that we purchased\n\n222\n00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:25,709\nthis product. So let me have a\n\n223\n00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:26,725\nlook. There we go. Look at that.\n\n224\n00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:28,181\nWe bought two of these and three\n\n225\n00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:30,357\nof those. Really cool. Okay, so\n\n226\n00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:31,525\nlet's get rid of these products\n\n227\n00:06:31,605 --> 00:06:32,837\nhere and let Me show you a bit\n\n228\n00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:34,877\nabout authentication. So this is\n\n229\n00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:37,037\nall custom made with next V5\n\n230\n00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:38,413\nfully upgraded. I'll show you\n\n231\n00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:39,477\nhow you can do sign in with\n\n232\n00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,261\nGoogle, sign in with GitHub and\n\n233\n00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:43,021\nalso a custom authentication\n\n234\n00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:45,375\nflow with resend and custom\n\n235\n00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:47,583\ndomains and password and two\n\n236\n00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,039\nfactor authentication. So let's\n\n237\n00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:50,327\njust make a quick account here\n\n238\n00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:52,175\nso I can demo it for you to\n\n239\n00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:54,991\ndevelop by Ed. I'll use this old\n\n240\n00:06:55,143 --> 00:06:58,343\nYahoo email that I had here.\n\n241\n00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,223\nSo let's add that as you can see\n\n242\n00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:03,023\nwhen you create a an account\n\n243\n00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,343\nyou're automatically going to\n\n244\n00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:06,071\nget an email confirmation. So\n\n245\n00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:07,439\nlet's see if that came true.\n\n246\n00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,167\nAnd as you can see this is going\n\n247\n00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:10,471\nto come straight from Ultimate\n\n248\n00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:12,473\nNext Start Store from deved. So\n\n249\n00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:13,417\nwe're going to hook that up to\n\n250\n00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:15,965\nthe domain when we click Verify.\n\n251\n00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,249\nAs you can see, we are in.\n\n252\n00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,745\nPerfect. So let's just head back\n\n253\n00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:21,969\nhere because I'll need this\n\n254\n00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:25,417\nYahoo to be opened up. So let's\n\n255\n00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:28,265\njust log in now. Now that my\n\n256\n00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:31,273\naccount is verified. There we\n\n257\n00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,321\ngo. And by default it's\n\n258\n00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,985\nautomatically going to generate\n\n259\n00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:37,201\nyou an icon here based on your\n\n260\n00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:38,705\nname. So it's going to do D.\n\n261\n00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,361\nOkay, there we go. But we can\n\n262\n00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,457\ncustomize this so if I come\n\n263\n00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:43,377\nhere, I can change my avatar and\n\n264\n00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,769\nalso come here and change our\n\n265\n00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:46,249\nname so I can say something like\n\n266\n00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:49,249\nJohn Doe. And we can also enable\n\n267\n00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:51,113\ntwo factor here and hit update\n\n268\n00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:52,281\nsettings. And as you can see,\n\n269\n00:07:52,353 --> 00:07:53,601\nsince this is a new user,\n\n270\n00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:54,465\nthey're not going to have the\n\n271\n00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:55,969\nanalytics and everything else\n\n272\n00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,081\nsaved there.
